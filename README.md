Reynardine
==========

### About

Inspired by the Fairport Convention version of the traditional song "Reynardine",
this accompaniment is designed to work with [node-red-contrib-music](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-music)
This in turn uses the sound synthesis engine [Supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).

When running this I also use a bass drone synth with a simple UI that you can find in the `synthdefs/bassdrone.scd` within the node-red-contrib-music installation. This runs directly inside supercollider, I usually use a drone chord D-A-E.

Once the beat has been started you can control the end-of verse three-chord progression by clicking on the button in the dashboard. In performance I have accessed this from a phone pointing at the node-red dashboard running on my laptop.
